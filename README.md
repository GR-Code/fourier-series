# fourier-series
## This utilizes N number of vectors to draw an arbitrary path using the Fourier Series.

Here's an attempt to replicate over the weekend what was illustrated in 3blue1brown's excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) on the subject.

Running the notebook installs the following packages: 
```
numpy
svgwrite
svgpathtools 
matplotlib
```

The script is capable of approximating one path from an SVG (as long as it's in the same working directory) in terms of N vectors. The value of N and the file can be swapped out if needed. Constructive criticism is always welcome.
